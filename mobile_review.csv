3.0,Fair,"A good budget phone under 11k. You can't expect high resolution camera with this price but surprisingly the front camera performs more than expectations.. Battery backup is decent, if you are a normal multi tasking user, you will get enough backup in a single charge.....A clean UI is always better than MIUI n others... Display, sound and built quality will not let you dissatisfied at all... I am using Moto G31 too and both the phones feel similar for normal usage... READ MORE"
